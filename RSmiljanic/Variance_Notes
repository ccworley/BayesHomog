I am sending you the parts of the code with the model that should work for the case with 3 nodes. I included the "teff.data", the new model "model.3nodes.matrix.bias", the inits and the run.jags statement.

The variance of a given node is parametrized in this way:

variance = beta1 * exp( beta2/ SNR ) + beta3

But I could not really run many tests to see if this is a good way to do it.
And a simpler alternative (that is already there but commented) is to use:

variance = beta1 * (1/SNR) + beta2

Feel free to test other options as well.

With this you can probably do the homogenization of the Giraffe results including the SNR dependence. But let me know if something breaks down.

If needed, and if there is time, I will come back to the parametrization with SNR for UVES later.
